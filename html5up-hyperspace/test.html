										<h3 class="gurei">Felix Langham</h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">My name is Felix Langham, I graduated in 2018, my student number is 3885080, and my team name is ‘Spurs’. I was born in Australia but my whole family is English. My favourite hobbies include snowboarding and Djing and going to the gym. My experience with IT includes self-taught SSH, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I built myself a gaming PC and have hacked x-box’s and administrator controls on laptops. I enjoy tackling the many challenges that arise in coding, the puzzles to solve so that my python code runs properly or figuring out the correct CSS so that my website does what I want it to do. Furthermore, I am interested in learning how to program as it is a highly employable skill and can be applied to a wide variety of fields.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Team Profile Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">My Myers Briggs test result showed the 'Commander' profile with code: ENTJ-A. Characteristics include: ENTJs are planners who often have schedules and courses of action planned. Highly rational, excel at taking charge and good at spotting problems. I would say this is somewhat accurate, as I like to make schedules, however I don't always follow through with them. Some strengths and weaknesses associated with ENTJs include being efficient, energetic and strong willed, as well as being stubborn, dominant and cold. As for my team composition and how these characteristics would impact behaviour in a group, results show that ENTJ’s would work well as leaders, however I would also be fine to have other leaders in the group and be delegated tasks from others. Furthermore, I think being direct and dominant could factor in causing group work to be efficient but at a lack of everyone being happy with the decisions made. Ultimately, these characteristics would not propose a big issue as I think I am able to be dynamic and work well in a variety of teams.<br>
										<br>
										According to this ‘VARK’ Learning style test, my strengths are in my ability to organize and plan in a  detail-oriented fashion. When assigned a project, I am able to easily establish order and structure plans. These results are inline with my Myers Briggs results and I would say they are fairly accurate. In addition, the results show that it is necessary for me to step away from administrative roles and share my own ideas and contribution to projects and not get stuck in planning and organisation, this is more true as I often find myself doing just that.<br>
										<br>
										According to the 'Big Five Personality Test' I scored highly in extroversion, emotional stability and conscientiousness. Whilst scoring lower in Intellect/Imagination and agreeableness. This means that I may be sociable, practical, calm, helpful and disciplined. These results indicate some of what has been shown in previous tests, being practical and disciplined and I would say are fairly accurate.

										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Ideal Job</h4>
										<p class="gurei">My ideal job is one that is remote, is in programming or development and preferably high paying. The position I have found includes front end development work, likely web development, specifically using React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. For this position it is required that you have 6+ years of development experience, and are highly proficient in React, TypeScript and JavaScript. Currently, I have less than 1 years of development experience and am only slightly proficient in JavaScript. In addition, the job listing states that it is preferable to have some experience in .NET, Cloud, and eCommerce. All of which I have no experience in. In order to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for this job I am going to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Supplementing this with personal projects and freelance work building up my experience whilst creating a portfolio using the aforementioned stack. Some examples of extracurricular activities I might undertake would be: creating apps, websites and doing online courses such as CS50.

										<h3 class="gurei">Ricky Yu Qi Yao</h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">Hello, my name is Ricky Yu Qi (Ricky) Yao, I graduated from East Doncaster Secondary College in 2020 and am now a first-year university student undergoing study for the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University, my student number being s3896813. I am an Australian born 2003/02/07 in Melbourne, Victoria coming from an Asian (Chinese) background. I enjoy playing video games and listening to music, it was the interest in both which led to my prominent usage of the internet and my laptop which increased my bond and affinity towards electronic devices. I am interested in the field of IT technologies due to its increasing growth and stability in the job market, providing a stable transition from student to employee in the future. Up until my studies at RMIT university, I had not before delved into the world of IT that much in terms of coding and network, but I am eager to learn. For assignment two, I will be working together within the team ’Spurs’.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Team Profile Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">In accordance with ‘Personality Profile’ I was represented as an ‘INFP’. As an INFP, we are described as being quite open minded, such that we are accepting of other opinions, thoughts, and perspectives. Additionally, INFP’s are perceived as being quite creative, having conventional thoughts and ideas. Within a team-based scenario, it is suggested that there will be a low level of conflict due to my accepting and tolerating character and may bring forth many unique and creative ideas during project and open scenarios.<br>
										<br>
										Being represented as an ISFJ-T by the Myer-Briggs 16 personality test, it presents my character as one which seeks constant improvement. As a result, I can competently seek for errors within systems with ideas on what and how to improve/resolve any issue. Within a team environment, I will be capable of assisting my team mostly in assessing the final components of the project, looking for potential issues and problems within the final solution, looking for methods and techniques which could improve the quality of the project.<br>
										<br>
										Using an online learning test, I have learnt that I am an Auditory/Visual learner meaning I learn best by hearing and listening rather than “doing”. As a result, I can learn most efficiently through an online environment where a tactile learner may fall. Within a team scenario, I will be able to learn and apply techniques easily online if the online campus is somehow compromised due to another COVID-19 style outbreak.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Ideal Job</h4>
										<p class="gurei">Being a network and/or security specialist is my ideal occupation. It requires qualifications within the fields of network architecture and cybersecurity, with essential tasks such as managing network infrastructures analysis of security measures and knowledge in technical support. Through discussions with the team, we have discovered that most of us are aiming for the long-term, aspiring to become a senior employee to earn stable income.

										<h3 class="gurei">Michael Lim </h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">Hello, my name is Michael Lim, my student code is s3543066 and my project’s group’s name is SPURS. I am an Australian born Chinese, and a Fourth year university student studying a Bachelor of Mechanical engineering at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I am fluent in English, and have basic knowledge of speaking mandarin and Japanese. My interest includes all forms of pop culture, technology, weightlifting, and socialising. My interest in Information Technology started with playing video games, which I have played since primary school. During high school, I was able to take IT as an elective. I learnt the basics of programming, and made simple applications and games. I learnt that coding and designing programs was a fun creative output. My studies at RMIT have taught me many concepts in the field of engineering and how they applied to real world situations. I hope to continue my studies and graduate from RMIT.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Team Profile Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">My result from the Myer Briggs test was “Turbulent Advocate” (INFJ-T). <br>
										<br>
										An Advocate (INFJ) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things.<br>
										<br>
										Advocate’s have the personal traits of introverted, intuitive, feeling and judging. I can definitely see myself having these traits. Being introverted, advocates are predominantly reserved when it comes to relationships. However, they communicate with insight and honesty.<br>
										<br>
										My result from the online learner type test was “Visual”. As a visual learner, the predominant aid to learn revolves around sight, an actual demonstration is easier to understand rather than a verbal instruction. Doing an internal simulation in their mind of the problem is a common way to help a visual learner remember or understand a concept. Ways to aid a visual learner in their studies would be color coding topics or ideas, lessening the audio instruction as they are easily distracted by sound and when learning in a classroom environment, sitting near the front as to reduce distractions.<br>
										<br>
										My result from the IPIP Big Five Factor test was a high percentage in “Extraversion” and a low percentage in “Intelligence/imagination”. As per the test, scoring high in Extraversion means to be outgoing and social.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Ideal Job</h4>
										<p class="gurei">The ideal job I seek is being a Mechanical Engineering Draftsman. The expectations of the occupation include: Aiding the marketing staff with quoting the material cost and expenses. Design and development of  the 3D models of possible parts, and assisting the progress of designs in major projects. This job interests me due to including one of the main areas of engineering I enjoy, which would be the modelling of possible parts used in the industry. The qualifications needed to acquire this type of job. Namely having completed a degree in higher education of engineering, and the being of proficient in of the many 3d modelling programs such as Autocad or Solid works.

										<h3 class="gurei">Collin Ng</h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">Hi! My name is Colin Ng (s3901105 - part of the SPURS group) and I’m in my first year of Bachelor of IT. I was born in Malaysia and when I was 4 years old my family migrated to Melbourne, which is where we’ve been living ever since. I graduated from Highvale Secondary College in 2020. I grew up in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne so my family and I are pretty westernised, and my siblings and I can only speak English, but we do still celebrate Asian cultural events like Chinese New Year.<br>
										<br>I’m super into basketball, skateboarding, playing video games (valorant got me cramming this assignment), working out in my backyard, and since Uni started, I’ve been really enjoying meeting new people and experiencing the Uni life. Recently I got my Ls, so I’ve been really getting into driving cars and car designs, especially the street car culture (JDM cars are so nice to look at).
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Team Profile Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">The results on my Myers Briggs Personality Type Indicator shows that I am an Entertainer (ESFP-T) with sub categories as explorer and social engagement.<br>
										<br>
										My responses to How-to-study.com - Learning Style Assessment indicates that my preferred learning style is Tactile/Kinetic. Tactile/Kinesthetic learners learn best when they can use their sense of touch and can move about.<br>
										<br>
										In the Truity.com - Big Five Personality Test I scored the highest in Extraversion (83%), being described as a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. My lowest score is conscientiousness (15%), meaning I have a very weak ability to exercise self-discipline and control in order to pursue my goals.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Ideal Job</h4>
										<p class="gurei">A cyber security analyst has the primary responsibility of protecting a company’s networks, systems, as well as the personal data of both employees and customers. They are in charge of implementing threat protection measures and security controls. They also have to keep up with the up-and-coming technological advancements in order to survey how these advancements can be used by potential hackers or maybe even utilised to protect a company from threats. This area of IT I find the most exciting because of how you are in constant need to check and improve a company’s defences, and understanding from a potential threats point of view and how to stop their attacks.

										<h3 class="gurei">Domenic Sinni</h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">Hello, my name is Domenic Sinni (s3900567 - part of the SPURS group) and I was born and raised in Melbourne and I am a first-year student after graduating from high school. I am studying Bachelor of Information Technology and I chose to complete my studies at RMIT for multiple reasons but mainly because of its reputation of being an excellent technology-based university and the location.<br>
										<br>
										I enjoy gaming, especially games like Call of Duty, NBA2K, Pokemon, Fortnite and Terraria. I also have a great passion for basketball and the NBA. I enjoy programming and while I only know the basics, I am trying to learn more and improve my skills in programming as I wish to be a programmer for my career.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Team Profile Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">The results of my Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator shows that I am an Adventurer (ISFP-T). This result was unexpected for me, as an Adventurer is seen as more of an extroverted personality type, whereas I consider myself as an introvert and I don’t have that much creativity, but this test result shows otherwise<br>
										<br>
										The results of my Online Learner Style test show I am a tactile learner, which means that I learn and work best when I am doing and touching things. I am also surprised by this result, as I feel like I learn best by listening and taking down notes or actively writing down and taking down information. This suggests that I should try to do things while I work and I may learn more.<br>
										<br>
										The results of my other Online Personality test show that my personality matches “The Harmonizers”. I personally feel like this result more accurately reflects my own personality as I do struggle to interact with others, but I would consider myself as a kind and warm person and people that do get to know me would find that out. I also do try to be practical and aware of other people.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Ideal Job</h4>
										<p class="gurei">My ideal job as of right now is being a programmer at a gaming company. I have a passion for programming and while I don’t have the skills as of right now to take on this kind of job, I am to gain the skills required for this job over the course of my time at university, by learning in class as well as practicing and teaching myself and learning from any other source I can.<br>
										<br>
										The skills required for this job include solid math skills, good communication skills, a passion for making games, the ability to work on multiple tasks concurrently, enjoy working with peers and with different teams, strong attention to detail and to be able to work without the need to be directed.<br>
										<br>
										The required qualifications for this job include a strong experience in using game engines (E.g. Unity), being involved in 1 or 2 major mobile projects, a strong background in programming and programming languages, and a tertiary degree or an equivalent qualification in a relevant field.<br>
										<br>
										I currently do not have any of the specified qualifications required for this type of position, however I aim to gain these qualifications over time, as I aim to finish my university course which will hopefully give me lots of skills based around programming and technology, and I will also start learning how to program games and gain experience using game engines in my own time.

										<h3 class="gurei">Sakamoto Tomoki</h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei"Hello. My name is Sakamoto Tomoki, my student code is s3821551 and my project’s group’s name is SPURS. I graduated from the National Institute of Technology, Kagoshima College in Japan after studying electrical and electronic engineering for 5 years. I was shocked by the high level of graduate students other than myself at the internship I did when I was in the 4th grade, and decided to go abroad (internship students other than myself are graduate students). I used to have a dog when I was in Japan, but since I came to Australia I have had four cats. and also mate cats and sell kittens. So far, I figured out buyers for kittens and sold 11 kittens.<br>
										<br>
										After studying as one of the college classes, my interest in IT began. The site I created after graduating from college gets over 300,000 PV every month and is profitable by affiliates and Google Adsense. For example, in an article I wrote about Nintendo Switch's new game "Monster Hunter" last month, it was accessed by nearly 5,000 people every day. Therefore, last month's sales $ 10,000 on Amazon. it's only the controller.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Team Profile Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">My Myers Briggs test result showed the 'Virtuoso' profile with code:ISTP-T. Characteristics include: In my case, it was written as this quiet and unobtrusive personality type. In fact, I've never been good at actively expressing opinions in school group work. However, I am good at guiding team members fairly from fairness, rationalism, and comfort, and having the ability to properly arrange all tasks in view, so I work as an auxiliary supporter for the team and can lead to better things.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Ideal Job</h4>
										<p class="gurei">For now, My ideal job is as a software engineer. In the future, I would like to develop applications and web services that people use on a daily basis. Also, I am interested in AR technology, so I would like to make something that makes full use of AR. But now I don't have the technology to develop applications. Therefore, I would like to develop a game-related smartphone app that uses the API during a student. (Already started developing it and plan to release an IOS app around the summer of this year.) First of all, I would like to make and release it and know what kind of things will be accepted by the market. I am going to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT to work as a software engineer in the future. I plan to develop world-class apps and services with the degree.

										<h3 class="gurei">Thorpe Honeyman</h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">I am Thorpe Honeyman, student number s3897395, of team SPURS. I am a first year student at RMIT, studying a Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born to an english family in northern England, and lived there until I was four and a half, when I moved to Australia. I have previously studied IT as a VET course during high school at Mullauna College.  In my free time I attend scouting groups, both as a rover, and as a trainee cubs leader. For cubs I attend weekly meetings where I help teach the cubs camping skills and run games. I also sometimes attend cubs camps where I help lead groups of cubs to activities, and ensure that they stay safe. When I’m not doing scouting I am usually playing card games and video games, mainly roguelikes such as Enter the Gungeon and The Binding of Isaac. I have been interested in IT since my high school allowed me to do it as an elective, and I have had a continual interest, mainly in building computers and linking them into networks.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Team Profile Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">The Myers-Briggs test said that I was an Adventurer, type ISFP-T, and as such that I express myself artistically.<br>
										<br>
										The Learning Style test said that I learn best from listening to information, or that I’m an Auditory learner.<br>
										<br>
										The Big Five Personality test showed that I have relatively average intelligence, emotional stability and conscientiousness, but higher than average agreeableness, and low extroversion.<br>
										<br>
										These tests express that I am easy to get along with, but have difficulties connecting with people initially. I also learn better when directly told information. They say I am a good problem solver, and that I show great empathy for others.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Ideal Job</h4>
										<p class="gurei">My ideal job is working as a network administrator, as it is an extension of my interest in IT, and uses many skills that I learnt during my VET course, which was directed towards the networking side of IT. The main skills required for this job are the ability to create and alter a network of computers, servers, router and switches, and the communication skills to ensure that I do what the client wants to the network.

						<h3>Written Comparison:</h3>
						<p class='mojii'>Upon analysis of our individual job aspirations, the variety of the jobs presented are broad whilst maintaining information technology as an integral piece of our jobs. Each individual aims to explore a different aspect of the IT world in their future occupations such as a front end developer, cybersecurity analyst, video game programmer/developer, network administrator, and software and network engineer.<br>
							<br>
							Some noticeable similarities within the ideal jobs includes the software engineer and video game programmer/developer, which are both programming heavy jobs, require a strong understanding of programming languages and scripts, which include Java, JavaScript, C#, Python and others. Other similarities can be found within the Network field jobs (Network Administrator & Network Engineer), as both are based in the same field, they require similar skills such as being able to create and configure networks, and network diagnosis and repair. In contrast, we have a senior in course studying Mechanical Engineering, who thus has an outlier in preferred occupation, as his job is more in the engineering field than in information technology. <br>
							<br>
							Almost all the ideal jobs chosen by the team members are high paying jobs, paying above AU$70,000 p.a. The main outlier would be Domenic’s chosen job, Video Game Programmer  job has the lowest annual average salary of AU$56,348 p.a, while the highest paying role is a Software Engineer, chosen by Tomoki with the annual average salary of AU$78,509 p.a.

						<h3 class="gurei">Github reflection:</h3>
						<p class="gurei">
							To document data and project progression, we utilised Google documents as the predominant storage of information collected by the group. Regrettably, as the website of the project was not seen as the main priority, it was not finalised or worked on much until the end of the project. Thus, the Github repository with its records of modifications are quite little, or even untouched by some of the members of the group. With this in mind, the group's mindset is that the Github repository does not fully represent the groups work ethic or time used on this project. Looking at the modification history of the google documents or watching the meeting recordings is a much more valuable record of our work ethic.

								<hr class="dotted">
								<h4 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
								<p class="moji">The highest ranked IT skills not associated with front end developers would be C++, Microsoft Office and Game engines. These are all highly sought after skills yet they have little application for the front end development career path.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h4 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
								<p class="moji">In terms of the top three highest ranking general skills that are not required in the front end development skill set, the top three would include: calm demeanour, honesty and integrity and ambition. As a front end developer it is often your job to simply write the code and work with designers on projects where they are creative and you put their vision into practice.</p>

								<h4 class="moji">Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h4>
								<p class="moji">After reviewing the Burning Glass data it comes to mind that my ideal job has stayed the same. There is plenty of demand for front end developers and many positions that require numerous skill sets which allows for lots of growth in career and skill sets. Furthermore, the data suggests that this is a job that is often done remotely which makes me want to do it even more.</p>

								<p class="moji">With unique jobs being presented by each individual, it is clear that there is a diverse range of skills within the field of information technology including knowledge of various coding languages, cybersecurity systems and networking. In terms of difficulty, coding languages are ranked amongst one of the most difficult skills to acquire as it requires users to learn key operators and have a key understanding of their application. However, this is not to depreciate the value of other skills as they all have key concepts which require dedication and time investment to understand. </p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h4 class="moji">How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>
								<p class="moji">In terms of essential attributes and abilities, they determined that the core characteristics required for their job were teamwork and communication based skills in addition to organizational and time management capabilities. It was identified that the ability to work together coherently with other individuals is an essential skill to have in the workforce in order to operate effectively to problem solve and ultimately meet the needs of client/organization.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h4 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
								<p class="moji">Top three ranking IT-specific skills are listed as SQL, javascript and JAVA in relation to March 2018 burning glass information. Though not essential, automation languages such as SQL and Java are very useful when creating network functions. In terms of other coding languages, python should be known as a baseline language however is ranked in 12th place in terms of demand. Javascript, though ranked 2nd, is not essential for a network engineer as their main area of operations are within networking infrastructures and not web developing. Used, but not recommended is SAP, however in the network engineering industry CCNA is preferred over deeming it ‘less’ required.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h4 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
								<p class="moji">All listed general skills are somewhat important within the workforce, however those not as essential within the network engineering line of work include:<br>
								- Leadership. Unless the occupation becomes a senior position, the ability to lead a group will be less required as management roles will be left to those higher in power.<br>
								- Mentoring. Similarly to leadership, unless you are placed in a senior positional role, the skill of mentoring will not be critical to fulfill the role.<br>
								- Decision making. Key decisions will be finalised by important personnel and not particularly for the role of a network engineer, though this excludes choices specifically within the network which require your problem solving and critical thinking.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h4 class="moji">Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h4>
								<p class="moji">Through analysis of my ideal job using the burning glass data provided to us on Canvas, it is apparent that my prior desired field to becoming a network specialist is not ranked very high in terms of demand and active selections coming at rank 160 with 56 active selections as of March 2018. Instead an occupation within the same field piqued my interest, with the job being a network engineer. This job was placed at rank 9 with 66 job postings. Similarly to network specialists, they both operate around networks.With similar job requirements, it seems like a good career decision as there will be more available work when I am ready to take on the workforce.</p>

I was disappointed in the fact of the low amount of listings for my ideal occupation of mechanical engineering draftsman. With this knowledge, I will now keep in mind to possibly shift my occupation choices. However, I will most likely still stay in the occupation type of mechanical engineering. </p>

								<p class="moji">In the field of programming and video game programming, many of the required IT skills in the field have to do with programming languages, and considering that a large portion of the skills in demand include knowledge of programming languages and other software tools like Java, Javascript and C#, my ideal job contains some of the more highly coveted skills within the industry</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h4 class="moji">How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>
								<p class="moji">The general skills that a video game programmer would require would include skills such as communication, problem solving, detail-oriented, analytical skills and decision making. These skills are some of the most highly coveted skills within the IT industry, and these skills are important for a video game programmer to have.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h4 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
								<p class="moji">The highest ranked IT related skills that are not required for a video game programmer would include SQL, SAP, and Business management. While not technically required, Project Management and Microsoft Windows would be appreciated in the skillset of a programmer, however knowledge of managing a business, SAP or SQL management are not required and have little relevance to a video game programmer.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h4 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
								<p class="moji">The three highest generic skills that aren’t necessary for a video game programmer would include Leadership, creativity, and research.

								<p class="moji">As an IT-specific skill, JavaScript is a coding technology required by all employers, and the skills required by each industry such as the game industry, network system, and security system are different. Also, it seems that software tools are also required for each programming technology.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h4 class="moji">How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>
								<p class="moji">Since developing as a team, communication skills with colleagues and project management skills are especially important. It seems that these skills are necessary so that the team as a whole can take steps to develop, and cover each other as facing a problem.</p>

						<h2>IT Work</h2>
						<h3>Network Engineer</h3>
						<p>
							Network engineer’s participant in the design the network infrastructures based on client needs/requirements, assessing information flow throughout and beyond a network system and ultimately the final implementation of the network. Network infrastructures include that of servers, switches, routers, firewalls, authorised devices, and several other electronic components. Performing tasks such as creating and reinforcing a network's firewalls provide the network with adequate protection to prevent data loss or compromise. Additional responsibilities include the successful integration of different parts such as the setting up and configuration of additional devices/equipment.
							<br>
							<br>
							Network engineers operate closely to their network architecture counterparts, this is as network architects design the network diagrams whilst the engineers create and implement these changes. Additionally, they also communicate closely to general staff to remain up to data with the status of the network, and to be aware in the event of an error. The communication between each department is crucial to the health of the network system, as the network professionals should be notified as soon as possible as soon as an error occurs to ensure minimal damage.
							<br>
							<br>
							Problem solving complications within a network when different software and hardware have compatibility issues during implementation into a network. Daily tasks can also include regular diagnosis and troubleshoots for the network systems to ensure that everything operates properly, and network correction when errors occur within the system. This can be through performing network upgrades, reinforcing firewalls, managing security configurations and checking for potential errors within the system.
							<br>
							<br>
							Problem solving issues within the network, determining compatibility issues, and working around them to ultimately implement the item into the system network. Network engineers may be required to take lead within internal investigations within a network to identify faults and errors, which requires foresight to ensure the investigations minimise downtimes to prevent any major disruptions to the companies operations.
						</p>
						<h3>Game Developer</h3>
						<p>
							Game developers create programs based on game plans to enable them to be playable. They perform programming after dividing each task under instruction of the game director, such as setting sound effects and sounds in different teams, building a game system, scenario operation, implementing menu screens, etc. Games are often programmed in languages such as Java,  Rudy and Swift, but in recent years there has been a lot of development with Unity.
							<br>
							<br>
							Game developers work closely with the game-planning team, game designers, and game sound teams. In order to create one game, they design the basis of the game (scenario etc.) with the planning team, as to which character will play the story and how. Next, in collaboration with game designers, they design what the in-game assets (characters, items, buildings, etc.) will be and what kind of effects will be produced. They work with the game sound team to implement sounds (background music, sound effects, etc.) to incorporate into the game. Each of these teams will work together to create a game. In addition, they have meetings often to confirm that each team is working well.
							<br>
							<br>
							Game developers spend most of their time coding.
							Game programmers create a game by programming the game so that it works as intended, according to the proposals and specifications created by the game producer.
							Furthermore, by repeating the corrections while checking if there are any problems with the program, then finally complete a game work that many people can play.
							Game developers are focusing on developing game software that allows them to experience new innovations in order to develop games that please their customers. If a developed game is too similar to the past, customers will get bored and leave to play other games, so it’s necessary to make a new game that will make customers have a game experience that attracts the attention of the customers, and that the game is something that everyone can enjoy playing. While it sounds easy, it's a very difficult task.
						</p>
						<h3>Web Designer</h3>
						<p>
							Web designers are responsible for creating the design for a website. They work with artistic principles to create something that is visually appealing, and with UX for ensuring that their design is user-friendly. They can often use applications such as Photoshop to create designs, to ensure that they look visually appealing, and logical, before a web developer creates the actual website.
							<br>
							<br>
							As with most IT professions, web designers usually work as a member of a team, in this case the other major part of the team being web developers. These two professions need to stay closely linked as the web designers are in charge of the aesthetic of the website that the web developers need to program. Web designers also often stay in contact with clients, as they need to ensure that their final design fits with what the client has asked for.
							<br>
							<br>
							As mentioned in question one, web designers spend most of their time in applications such as Photoshop, where they work on ensuring that the websites’ designs are user friendly, both in how pleasing they are to the eyes, but also how well the websites are organised.
							<br>
							<br>
							The most challenging aspect of being a web designer is not coming up with a design that looks visually appealing and functional, or using editing software, to create a good design. The toughest part of their position is creating a good design, while working around what the client wants. All other parts of their job become almost second nature due to how often they use them, but the requests from clients vary, and could cause their well thought out designs to fall apart.
						</p>
						<h3>Software Engineer</h3>
						<p>
							The responsibilities of a Software engineer predominately are the back door management of the specified technology given to them from their client. This would have been the designing and developing of the necessary code needed to run a program given hardware limitations. This would also include the debugging of an old software, to aid in its efficiency, or the creation of a new software, which a client could have requested the creation of .
							<br>
							<br>
							In the modern day workforce, the role of software engineer has evolved to include not only the backend software management, but also the frontend client management. Software engineers commonly work in teams of multiple software developers, all in their own right IT professionals. They are now required to communicate with clients and other professionals to learn the specific parameters of the desired system, discussing with them the limitations of the hardware and software given. These discussions would also be affected by the possible investors, being one of the key influences in the production of the software.
							<br>
							<br>
							The majority of the time of a software engineer is dependent on the type of job given to them by their client. This could include but not limited to; Improving the efficiency of an old program a client has given for revision. Development and designing of a new software to fit the specific needs of the client. Maintaining or updating, an existing codebase to help it keep up to date with modern technology. All of these jobs require the software engineer to be in constant communication with their team to help split the work and mitigate possible mistakes a single person might make. These jobs usually take between a few weeks to even months of development to complete, as to reinforce the importance of  how much weight the software has on any project.
							<br>
							<br>
							The most challenging aspects of the position of a software engineer would be for  the time commitments needed for any given project. Given the requirements of the possible clients and investors, a lot of projects require a lot of work with very little time to complete said project. The engineers are required to invest long hours just sitting in front of a computer reading and rereading mountains of code, to try to perfect it to the required standard of the client. This not only requires intensive problem solving skills but also may harm the software engineering physically with possibly determinants to their posture due to the prolonged sitting at a desk, but also possible mental stress due to the amount of work given the restricted time frame.
						</p>
						<h3>Cybersecurity Specialist</h3>
							<p>
								Cybersecurity has many applications and various uses but in general those working in the sector are responsible for detecting and preventing cybersecurity attacks on their employers’ network or organisation. In addition to this they provide ongoing security during the development stages of software systems, data centers and networks. Furthermore, they are tasked with searching for vulnerabilities and risks in hardware and software whilst managing and monitoring any attacks and 	intrusions on an ongoing basis. There are a wide variety of programming languages and used for this job with some including, PHP, Python, C++ and Java. The workload can vary from day to day from detecting and preventing attacks on their networks to more hands on work in which they may be training co-workers how to avoid malicious emails in order to keep them protected.
								<br>
								<br>
								A cybersecurity specialist majority of the time will interact with the other employees under the IT Department. A strong relationship with the IT Department ensures that the cybersecurity specialist has access and a good understanding of how that specific businesses IT structure works. Cybersecurity specialists will communicate with the IT department to further enhance the technological security of the business. Cybersecurity specialists will also inform the CEO of a business if they believe a serious cybersecurity threat has or may occur. Being the most knowledgeable, the cybersecurity specialist will be able to explain in detail how this threat will impact the businesses operations.
								<br>
								<br>
								Cybersecurity professionals can find themselves dividing their time between a multitude of tasks on a daily or weekly basis. Most of their time will be devoted to detecting and preventing cybersecurity attacks by running a multitude of tests on the network in order to determine any problems and if there are any problems figuring out solutions. Furthermore, they may be training other employees in how to avoid malicious content which may negatively impact the network. Other menial tasks can include writing reports, checking emails, inspecting logs, redundancy testing and communicating with other members of the IT team and other employees to see if they are facing any issues.
								<br>
								<br>
								The most difficult part of being a cyber security specialist is keeping up with new trends and new procedures. There needs to be constant vigilance when it comes to keeping technological security, and a cyber security specialist has to always be learning about new technologies in order to understand how potential threats can use these technologies to infiltrate the business. These new technologies can also be utilised to enhance the technological security of the business, but a cyber security specialist must also know how to merge both new and existing technologies without creating a weakness in the technological defenses. Not keeping up with new trends and procedures can open up vulnerabilities in the businesses technology, and the cybersecurity specialist will be to blame.

				<!-- Four IT Technologies-->
				<section id="four" class="wrapper style1 fullscreen fade-up">
					<div class="inner">
						<h2>IT Technologies</h2>
						<h3>Clouds, Services and Servers</h3>
						<img src="images/cloud.jpg">
						<h4>What does it do?</h4>
						<p>
							Clouds – also known as cloud computing – refers to the delivery of computing-based services, such as databases, servers, networking, storage, software and more, over the internet (referred to as the cloud) to offer flexible resources and fast innovation.
							<br>
							<br>
							If a business wishes to have the flexibility of the internet combined with the storing data, then cloud is a great way to store data and information at a cost-efficient price, as in most cases, you only pay for the services that you use. This can be used as an advantage in a business by lowering the operation costs and assists in making the business more efficient.
							<br>
							<br>
							Some of the major benefits of this technology and why it is commonly used among businesses includes:
							<br>
							<br>
							Cost: Cloud computing wipes out the capital cost involved in purchasing hardware and software, as well as the set up and execution of on-site data centres, including servers, and even the cost of hiring IT experts to manage the foundation. This proves as a major advantage especially for smaller businesses with smaller budgets, being able to set up and use servers for cheaper prices.
							<br>
							Speed: Most cloud-based services and features are provided as on the go, meaning that it can be accessed and applied from anywhere and, typically, very quickly, which improves efficiency and allows for more flexibility.
							<br>
							Productivity: Cloud computing defeats the purpose of hardware setups, the need to patch software and other problems that come with on-site data centres. This allows businesses to focus more on achieving business objectives as there is no longer a constraint in terms of accessing data, as anyone with authority can access their network servers given, they have sufficient connection.
							<br>
							Performance: The best and most expansive Cloud computing services run on networks that contain data centres which consistently are upgraded to the latest and fastest technologies to allow fast and efficient cloud computing services. These upgrades allow for little network latency and increased performance.
							<br>
							<br>
							Cloud computing has already changed the way that businesses work today. With the Covid-19 pandemic forcing a lot of businesses online, cloud computing was there to help and assist businesses in staying alive during the pandemic. Cloud computing allows employees to stay online while at home, so that employees could complete their daily tasks from the safety and comfort of their own home. It also ensures that businesses stay connected from multiple different locations and it will not slow down a business that is trying to achieve its goals, even from home.
							<br>
							<br>
							As for the future of cloud computing, it is expected to continue to grow even larger and become more extensive soon. 81% of companies with 1000 or more employees have applied the use of a multi-platform strategy, with that number expected to be increased to 90% by 2024. Some improvements that are expected to be made to cloud computing within the next few years would include the security and compliance of cloud computing, as at this time, a lot of stakeholders amongst businesses expect the cloud service providers to also provide the security for the data, when this is not the case. This security is bound to take a rise soon, as it can be a potential concern for businesses who are not as adept with keeping their data secure.
						</p>
						<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
						<p>
							With the flexibility that cloud services offer, integration of such technologies will appeal to major companies. By utilising services like Google Drives, iCloud and Dropbox, employees are all able to access data simultaneously through a singular, centralised unit allowing them to view and edit the data anywhere. This in turn bypasses the requirement that employees must show up to work physically to perform tasks as companies may create an online network from which each employee can conveniently access from online.
							<br>
							<br>
							Going forward with cloud technologies, organisations and major companies may want to integrate cloud servers and services into the work system as it will allow for more flexible employment and the distance becomes less of a factor. The integration of cloud systems will also include financial advantages, as cost compared to physical servers are much cheaper. As a result, the usage and market for large, physical, industry sized storage units may be discarded and replaced with new cloud systems.
							<br>
							<br>
							In addition to aiding large companies and organisations, cloud services also influence individual’s day to day lives with services such as email. Emails sent two and forth will be preserved indefinitely (depending on life of service) on the email’s storage service with each item being sent almost instantaneously between one another, resulting in a service which greatly excels in performance in comparison to postal services. Subsequently, many individuals opt to utilise emails rather than postal services.
							<br>
							<br>
							Despite all the benefits cloud servers and services provide, there remain environments where traditional servers/ services may operate more efficiently in comparison to cloud technology. The main weakness of cloud technology is its dependency on network connection, and its required presence to operate. In the event of a power outage, a company fully integrated with cloud services would be rendered completely obsolete as no one would be able to access their work. Given this scenario, traditional systems would provide operational services, though not as swiftly or efficiently as cloud systems.
						</p>
						<img src="images/cloud2.png">
						<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
						<p>
							Considering the apparent availability of cloud servers and services due the abundance of applications offering their services, many individuals such as myself will opt towards this option for cloud services data storage and team operation capabilities. When performing group projects or collaborations, teammates are required to work together to complete documents and collate thoughts and ideas. Typically, participants would be required to be present by one another to complete these forms of tasks, however by using cloud resources such as google docs or dropbox, members of the group are able to access and edit documents from a centralised file storage area in addition to allowing access to those not physically present, given they have access to adequate network connection.
							<br>
							<br>
							Though many cloud services provide a free service, most paid cloud server hosting services are quite cheap as opposed to purchasing hardware and software from the market, leading it to be the most viable option for students without a large budget. For families who may own a business of their own may require databases to store and keep track of data, this may include inventory and stock of items, profits and losses etc. These families will be able to store information and data using services such as Azure Cloud, HostGator, Nexcess and many other sources. By utilising cloud server services, the businesses will be able to swiftly create and have an operational database server which they will be able to create, store and manage crucial business information and documents.
							<br>
							<br>
							With how easy it is to implement a cloud server as opposed to one on-site/on-premise, and it’s sheer convenience, cloud computing will almost definitely become a staple for many families, friends.
						</p>
						<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
						<img src="images/cyber1.jpg">
						<h4>What does it do?</h4>
						<p>
							Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as hardware, software and data from cyberthreats or digital attacks.’  Protection of this kind is used on most networks that connect databases, from schools to businesses to government databases. Cyberattacks on these networks are generally targeted at accessing, altering, or destroying sensitive information by gaining unauthorized access, using this information to extort money from users, or to interrupt the workflow of businesses or popular services. Various elements of cybersecurity include cloud based DDoS mitigation, application security, data security, cloud security and end user security, which protect from various forms of malware and network attacks. Cybersecurity does an integral role in protecting and securing any networks or data for businesses or individuals.
							<br>
							<br>
							Data clearly shows that cybersecurity is becoming more necessary every year as attacks are increasing as damage to businesses and individuals grows rapidly. As of 2018 statistics show that 93.6% of malware had the ability to constantly change its code to evade detection, and as a whole almost 50% of business PC’s that got infected got reinfected in the same year.
							<br>
							<br>
							With the development of new technologies comes new cybersecurity risks which must be managed and mitigated creating demand for cybersecurity specialists whilst also creating a plethora of opportunities for cyber-criminals. Cybersecurity employs many methods in order to protect networks and data from attacks. Of these many methods some of the most common as of now include: firewalls, antimalware, encryption, identity and access management, VPNs, and cloud security.
							<br>
							<br>
							‘Firewalls are systems designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network.’ Firewalls are one of the most commonly employed tools, and pre-installed on computers in the form of ‘windows defender’ for Microsoft users. Antimalware is known to most people by the common brands of McAfee and Norton Antivirus. Such programs are effective at protecting individual computers and when installed on all computers on a network are greatly effective at finding and removing or protecting from malicious threats. Encryption is used by most people whether they know it or not on apps such as WhatsApp which have a system of end-to-end encryption which ensures that no one apart from the sender and the receiver have access to data which is sent between them.
							<br>
							<br>
							Developing technologies in the cybersecurity space that will likely be widely adopted over the next few years including blockchain technology and next-generation firewalls. Blockchain technology is currently used as a way of recording and tracking digital assets such as bitcoin and is yet to achieve more mainstream acceptance apart from cryptocurrencies which are still somewhat niche. The potential of blockchain for use in the cybersecurity industry is enormous however. Blockchains are extremely hard to hack, making them perfect for protecting data. If for some reason an attacker gained access to data stored on a blockchain, they wouldn’t be able to read it due to encryption. In addition, due to blockchains decentralization, it is far more difficult for hackers to successfully execute DDoS attacks.
							<br>
							<br>
							Next-generation firewalls are an upgraded version of a traditional firewall, featuring much faster threat detection, greater network visibility and the ability to integrate with other tools in order to prevent malware from accessing the network.
							<br>
							<br>
							Some companies are already developing ‘NGFWs’ projects as well as blockchain cybersecurity solutions, however, in order for these technologies to flourish successfully it would require the mainstream adoption of blockchain technologies as well as NGFWs as they are somewhat niche as of now. NGFWs will pick up popularity and development as time goes on. However is a slightly different story, it is most well known for bitcoin which follows market cycles which involve lots of hype results in long periods of waning interest afterwards. Once people can see the value in blockchain aside from its crypto related hype and see the potential for real world cybersecurity uses, development and innovation of blockchain related cybersecurity solutions will become more widely adopted.
						</p>
						<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
						<p>
							The constantly evolving field of cybersecurity has tremendous potential and is already developing at a fast pace. In the past, technology was not nearly as integrated into businesses as it is in the modern day. Most businesses did not need a cybersecurity specialist as they were not heavily dependent on technology. But as time went on and technology advanced, new businesses were utilising new technologies to gain a competitive edge over rival businesses. Also new tech companies were being started and growing huge inside. This caused all IT related jobs to see a growth in demand, especially those in the cybersecurity field. Nowadays strong cyber security is crucial in many businesses in order to protect sensitive information and data that the business uses.
							<br>
							<br>
							Customers of businesses want to see better security of their data, and having a good cybersecurity department will do that. IT specialists also now have a different avenue for their career that they can take advantage of, and having that background in IT will greatly help them. Employers also now are looking for cyber security specialists and analysts, and will pay a lot of money for them. Many businesses understand the need for a strong cybersecurity department and will pay top dollar for one. This will not make any jobs redundant, but will actually create more jobs specifically for the cyber security field. As a result of this, traditional IT specialists or managers will actually have more time to focus on their respective responsibilities, as in the past they would need to also handle the cyber security of the business.
							<br>
							<br>
							This boom in the cybersecurity field means more technology developed solely for cybersecurity use will occur. New software and hardware will allow cybersecurity departments to better defend the technological security of their business.
						</p>
						<img src="images/cyber2.jpeg">
						<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
						<p>
							Cybersecurity will greatly affect my day to day life, as technology takes up a large part of it. Cybersecurity will ensure the devices I use daily are secure from potential hackers or threats stealing my data or compromising important information. For example I use my phone to store personal information and data, as well as use it to access banking information. Cyber security allows me to do all these things without being worried about these things being compromised.
							<br>
							<br>
							Cyber security also indirectly affects me through external sources. For example when I go to RMIT Campus to study or attend classes, I utilise the free wifi they provide. Without cybersecurity, a hacker could use the RMIT free wifi to steal my personal information and data on my laptop. Even if I was vigilant with how I use my laptop (not using shady links, not sharing passwords, etc) my laptop could still be compromised without cybersecurity keeping the RMIT free wifi secure.
							<br>
							<br>
							Cybersecurity also affects my friends and family. For example an older generation like my grandparents have very little knowledge about how to use modern technology. This makes them extremely vulnerable to potential hackers or scammers trying to take advantage of their lack of knowledge for their financial gain. An increase in cybersecurity jobs not only gives greater protection to people like my grandparents as the technology they use will be more secure from threats, it allows other people to help the more vulnerable technology users to be protected (installing anti-virus for them, setting up a firewall on their computers, etc). I also have a younger brother who is about 12 years old. This makes him just as vulnerable as older people, but from a different threat (child predators, scammers, etc). This increase in cybersecurity jobs helps people of all ages.

						<h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
						<img src="images/car1.png">
						<h4>What does it do?</h4>
						<p>
							While currently cars are driven by people, autonomous vehicles are vehicles controlled without humans. This is done with cameras and other sensors on the outside of the car analysing the surrounding situation, so that the car can move under computer control rather than human operation. Ultimately, autonomous driving technology aims to reduce accidents, traffic jams and provide people with safe and comfortable driving.
							<br>
							<br>
							Currently, there are still no perfect Autonomous vehicles that can drive on public roads. However, development using 5G (high-speed and large-capacity data transmission) is underway as state-of-the-art technology. Information detected by the vehicle sensor is transmitted to the cloud to collate large quantities of data related to congestion status and accident status. Autonomous vehicles are built with mechanisms to predict danger by acquiring the necessary information from the stored data.
							<br>
							<br>
							For now, it is possible to enable autonomous driving under certain circumstances. TOYOTA recently launched a vehicle equipped with autonomous driving technology that can be used on highways with speeds less than 30km/h. Tesla, which is famous for its autonomous driving technology, has already sold vehicles that can self-park, change lanes, and autonomously drive on highways under certain conditions. However, their Society of Automotive Engineers level is 2.
							<br>
							<br>
							-Definition of Society of Automotive Engineers-
							<br>
							Level 0. No driving automation: Driver performs all dynamic driving tasks.
							<br>
							Level 1. Driver Assistance: This system can control the movement of either the vehicle acceleration or deceleration, or handle operation. The vehicle can be kept safe at a vehicle-to-vehicle distance between the front and rear of the car.
							<br>
							Level 2. Partial Driving Automation: The system can control acceleration, deceleration and steering at the same time. It has the function to help the vehicle stay in the lane or self-parking features.
							<br>
							Level 3. Conditional Driving Automation: The environment detection function allows the system to perform all driving tasks. However, If the failure occurs the system requires operation by a human.
							<br>
							Level 4. High Driving Automation: The system can replace all driving operations. Even if the system fails, it can be operated automatically without human intervention. However, humans have the option of driving manually.
							<br>
							Level 5. Full Driving Automation: The difference between level 4 is the height of the quality of the automatic operation technology. It does not require human intervention and provides a higher and more sophisticated service than human driving.
							<br>
							<br>
							There is a big gap between level 2 and 3 automation, but many vehicle manufacturers are eagerly developing it. When it comes to level 3 vehicles, the ‘driver’ is not responsible for any accidents that occur (at least in Japan).
							<br>
							<br>
							If development goes well, vehicles equipped with Level 3 advanced autonomous driving technology will definitely be sold within three years for use on public roads. Ultimately, each country must amend the law to prepare for autonomous vehicles running on public roads to ensure that any issues are under responsibility of the appropriate parties. Since the autonomous vehicle of level 3 is going to spread, it is expected to alleviate the congestion on the highway by vehicles that perform the appropriate operation in accordance with the situation. In addition, it will lead to suppressing the fatigue of drivers.
							<br>
							<br>
							In addition, in order for the automatic driving level to improve to 3 and 4 in the future, it is necessary to improve the judgment performance of AI. The system must be able to safely protect pedestrians and drivers by having AI judge all the measures to be taken in the unlikely event that the vehicle is unable to drive due to bad weather during driving or just before an accident occurs. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the performance of AI.
						</p>
						<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
						<p>
							It is predicted that the way we use automobiles will change as autonomous driving becomes practical. After we no longer need human driving, we can spend our free time in the car doing business, talking with friends or family, sleeping, etc. rather than focusing on driving cars ourselves.
							<br>
							<br>
							The benefits of the change will likely have the biggest impact on our goods transportation. Until now, many packages have been transported to various places by trucks operated by drivers, but the elimination of drivers reduces transportation costs and leads to lower product prices. There is also the possibility that new services will be born. It allows vehicles to become small shops and do business anywhere on the road. This also leads to cheaper sales of products because there is no need for land charges and sales staff at the store. Another advantage of this service is that you can sell it in areas where it was previously difficult to purchase. For example, areas with a high elderly population, or low-population areas.
							However, it is predicted that some jobs of driving a car will disappear with the spread of autonomous vehicles, such as bus drivers and taxi drivers. Automation has eliminated the need for jobs such as typists, telephone operators, and elevator operators so far. Likewise, the profession of driver is likely to disappear. In addition to this, if store-free services using autonomous driving become widespread, retail sales staff and shopping centres may become unnecessary. Furthermore, as an effect of autonomous driving, families will be "using a car without owning it”. This will cause the number of people who don't have a driver's license to increase, as it will no longer be needed, and autonomous taxi costs are cheaper so the number of people who use taxis will grow larger. Therefore, automobile manufacturers will not sell vehicles to individual customers, but instead sell to companies that use vehicles in the future.
						</p>
						<img src="images/car2.jpg">
						<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
						<p>
							I think that the spread of this autonomous driving technology will have a positive impact on our lives. There are five typical impacts on us.
 							<br>
							1. Efficient reduction of time spent in the car. According to a survey conducted by Citroën (cited in hamanaka 2018), the total time spent in the car is about 2 years and 5 months in lifetime, and if we can make travelling more efficient, we can reduce the time that we spend, and have a great impact on our lives and health.
							<br>
							2. The number of traffic fatalities and injuries will decrease due to Autonomous driving. In recent years, the number of traffic accidents caused by elderly drivers and young drivers has increased, but the autonomous car is unaffected by age and driving experience, so these accidents can be significantly reduced.
							<br>
							3. Solving the labour shortage problem. Especially in developed countries, the labour shortage is becoming more serious as many countries have declining birth-rates and aging population. If automatic driving is realized, the problem of driver shortage will be solved.
							<br>
							4. Response to a population aging. As mentioned earlier, if self-driving vehicles are used, they will be used as a means of transportation for the elderly who cannot drive. Parents will also be freed from labour and time, such as picking up their children.
							<br>
							5. Reduction of CO2 emissions. Efficient driving is expected by AI, and smooth traffic will lead to a significant reduction in unnecessary distance, which in turn reduces CO2 emissions.
							<br>
							<br>
							In the future, we believe that we will be able to utilize our travel time for new things in our daily lives. To be honest, travelling by car is boring. With autonomous vehicles, you can do your own business or study during your travel time. You will definitely be able to use your morning and return travel time effectively, and spend more time playing games and sleeping at home.

						<h3>Internet of Things (I.O.T) Sensors</h3>
						<img src="images/iot1.jpg">
						<h4>What does it do?</h4>
						<p>
							The rapid progression of technology in the world has changed our way of life in many ways unimaginable to anyone in the 20th century, making what used to be tedious tasks into a simple one. As society is progressing towards automation, inventors have designed and implemented many new technical devices to aid in the field of automation including the Internet of Things.
							<br>
							<br>
							The Internet of Things defines the vast, diverse range of physical items which have been integrated with sensors, software and other technologies which allows data exchange over a network and/or the internet. The implementation of such technologies allows objects to connect to the internet to collect, compile and transport data without the aid of human input, allowing for actions to take place autonomously.
							<br>
							<br>
							A section of IoT includes sensors, which are devices which are able detect and measure change, respond to external information and communication detections and actions across the internet. These different sensors come in different forms, detecting, and responding to different external environments. Sensors include temperature sensors, which identifies the heat energy levels of a certain source, pressure sensors that detect changes in pressure, proximity sensors that will sense an item/objects distance between the device, accelerometers, which track the rate of change in an object's speed and optical sensors which converts rays of light into electrical signals.
							<br>
							<br>
							Currently there are around 7 billion different types of IoT devices, by the time of 2025 it is estimated there will be 25 billion. As the technology advances and time passes, IoT devices have been and will continue to integrate themselves into all kinds of different areas of expertise. Some examples of possible future projects could be; a smart agriculture system, one which could monitor the produce, and automatically do the entire farming process, from sowing the seeds to the harvesting of the finished product, possibly even notifying the farmers if there are variables which would make it unsuitable to grow the produce. These actions could be received as feedback and sent to a phone device, giving all sorts of useful data to the farmer. Another project idea could be a weather reporting system. With the use of temperature, humidity, and rain sensors, it could relay the data and possibly even predict weather for the coming days, given the changes in the temperature, wind direction and humidity of the air. Lastly, the simplest yet most likely project that is to arise from IoT technology, an fully automated home system. Having full control over all appliances via an application on a smart device would be one of, if not the most useful thing that could come about from implementing IoT technology into their household to a general person. Being able to simply change the temperature from an air conditioner, or turn off the stove or lights, all from simply pressing a button on a phone would make the everyday life of a general person so easy and convenient.
							<br>
							<br>
							This development is possible due to the advancement of normal technology, and the basic human drive to always make technology smarter, more powerful and for it to be convenient and efficient. IoT devices are the simple evolution of technology, once the technology has reached its peak in its function, all that is left is to improve the device by having it do its designed task automatically. As doing so will allow even more progression, reducing the workload on humans and giving them even more time to try to improve the technology.
						</p>
						<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
						<p>
							The biggest improvement that development of the internet of things will bring, is that it will help with local and global interconnectivity. While our current world is very interconnected, the ability to have all devices linked into one big network allows people from different parts of the world to much more easily communicate with each other.
							<br>
							<br>
							Another big change that would be brought around is that many monotonous tasks would be able to be don’t without human intervention. Tasks such as transferring data and files could be set up, collating relevant information from across the world. File storage would likely also be improved, as the interconnectivity could facilitate files forming backups with less effort.
							<br>
							<br>
							The final big improvement that IoT will bring about is ease of access. Currently, many devices are majorly different methods of use. With IoT, people could access the functions of devices that they don’t understand from devices they have used and are comfortable with.
							<br>
							<br>
							This change would likely help people who have very little experience with computers, such as elderly people, as it would allow them to have the convenience of all devices, while only needing to understand a single device.
							<br>
							<br>
							Similar to all new technologies, the biggest negative impact is that it has the capacity to make certain jobs redundant. As IoT links many devices and systems together, human input can be removed from many processes. Some jobs which could be replaced by this technology are things like airspace coordinators, where they take aeroplane locations and weather conditions into account, when deciding if more aeroplanes can take off or land. This same job could be done by computers, which could be further helped by further connections between all devices. In the past, similar things have happened, with jobs like tellers being replaced by ATMs, as machines are better equipped to deal with the information given.
						</p>
						<img src="images/iot2.jpg">
						<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
						<p>
							Personally, as a young adult, the internet of things is mostly a beneficial thing, as it helps predominantly with making the basic tasks of everyday life even easier. The fundamental principles of advancing technology into IoT technology are to allow a seamless ease of control over all aspects of our technology in our household, from our basic home appliances to the security system of a home.
							<br>
							<br>
							Depending on the advancement of technology, one of the key differences could be allowance of complete power over monitoring and manipulating every aspect of a house. Be it simply turning off the lights or changing the temperature of an air conditioner, all whilst simply touching a button on a mobile device. This could even allow someone to be instantly notified, if say a sensor is triggered once an unexpected person arrives at the front of their house, possibly even activating the home’s protection shutters. These actions could possibly happen even if you were away from your home, as long as the system at home is still active and is connected to your mobile device.
							<br>
							<br>
							When it comes to possible changes affecting family members, it is dependent on the age of the family member. Some of the more elderly members would most likely see the technology as foreign and cumbersome, possibly ignoring its existence and forgo even using it. While younger family members would most likely quickly adapt to the change in technology, as it would just be something else which they just started to learn. This also applies to affecting my friends, as most of my friend groups at this current age are, like myself, young adults. They should have a smooth transition, quickly adapting to the change and implementing the technology into their lives as well.

				<!-- Six Group Reflections -->

						<h2>Group Reflections</h2>
						<p>
							Analysis on assignment performance in regards to <br>
							progression, contribution and efficiency.
						</p>
						<h3>Collective Reflection</h3>
						<p>
							With the completion of this assignment, it has come to our attention that, overall, the group worked relatively well together. This being a first year first semester course, for most of the members in the group this would have been their first major assignment. Which forces them into the situation of working together with many people they are unfamiliar with.
							<br>
							<br>
							The main positives of team SPURS were that the quality of work produced was deemed satisfactory by the group, though there were many aspects of the project that could have been better performed. In particular in the IT work section, it would have been beneficial for the group to have done an interview with an IT professional instead of just referencing ten articles, as it would have introduced us to a real professional and it would have given us experience with interacting in a work environment. When it came time to divide the workload and split the members into mini groups, the teamwork and input of most members was relatively evenly distributed. There were of course some members who went above and beyond, putting in more input into this project than others. Though not always productive, it was discovered that the group could work at a quick and efficient pace when properly motivated. Whenever a group member had trouble with collecting research or completing their section of the assignment, other members would help them understand the possible problem and resolve the misunderstanding. One of the major positives of our group was that the group would consistently hold the two Microsoft Teams meetings per week requirement, with an average participation with most of the group members. Though the discussion was not always relevant, the environment in the meetings was very approachable and the group did not have any major disagreements.
							<br>
							<br>
							The main negatives of team SPURS were that our time management skills were quite poor, even with having consistent meetings and a proper timeline to schedule the project’s completion, the group would consistently not complete work by the initial deadline. Whilst, not with all members there was a lack of communication with some of the members, not attending the group meetings or even not contacting the group for days at a time. Lastly, most probably the largest negative of working with the group would have been a complete lack of productivity during the initial first two weeks of the assignment, had the group worked properly and productively the work quality would have most likely been much higher given the larger time constraint.

									Working with my team ‘Spurs’ has overall been an enjoyable experience with group members being engaged and happy to participate. Each member got their work done in an efficient manner and each had good input.
									<br>
									<br>
									The quality of the work of the group and the pace at which it was completed were some things the group flourished in. Furthermore, the participation in group meetings on ‘Microsoft Teams’ as well as in class was very good with most of the group members showing up consistently. There were some issues with getting work done by certain dates and communicating however, it all came together in the end. I learned that communication is very important and is something that could be improved upon.
									<br>
									<br>
									Collin’s ongoing input on the group project was very helpful as it was his idea. Ricky showed great leadership qualities, taking charge of group organisation which was very effective. Tomoki’s skills in coding were well utilized when building the website, creating an efficient and aesthetic design. Domenic and Thorpe were good at giving insightful advice on sticking points in the project as well as Michael who was effective at completing work and giving insightful input.
									The GitHub activity does not accurately reflect the groups involvement as group members were working on different aspects of the assignment throughout, and the website was only made at the end.

									The group assignment ‘Team Project’ was completed with speed and efficiency, though the initial start-up was less than ideal, we eventually got a good grasp on how we would complete our tasks and cooperated with ease until the project was completed.
									Regarding the project, there could have been better communication between the team members as task prioritization and time management were lacking with long periods of time where we did not know which area had to be completed.
									<br>
									<br>
									In terms of teammates, I found all members of team Spurs to be quite good. Michael presented great leadership skills in the forefront of the project, organising and speaking in the majority of the teams’ meetings. Thorpe previewed excellent English capabilities and quality checked a lot of our work, in addition to great flexibility providing help to members and overall staying on top of the project. Tomoki shows exceptional skills in website formatting, leading head in the battle of formatting the final website. Domenic and Collin utilised their expertise and extensive knowledge in the field of Basketball to further implement features into the ‘hoop stats’ idea. Felix showed innovation proposing many suggestions during the write up of project documents.
									<br>
									<br>
									Github was not an accurate representation of our contribution as we utilised google docs to complete and track the progress of our tasks.

									Overall, the experience working with team SPURS was a pleasant one, no disagreements came about, and the assignment documentation is formal and well structured. I felt the time management of the group was somewhat poor, I hope that next time the group follows the designed project timeline.
									<br>
									<br>
									The member inputted the most was Ricky, if not for him leading the group, I do not believe the group would have finished in time. Tomoki is the most technology proficient, his knowledge in coding and his input into the website and code are the reason the website completed so well. Thorpe’s language skills were the reason the writing quality in this assignment is in a clean formal structure; without him the assignment quality would have been much lower. Domenic’s upbeat personality kept the environment of the group interactions calm and enjoyable. His input made it so no disagreements happened, and the work could progress smoothly. Collin’s project idea was the selected project, his ideas expanded into what it is now, he is the reason why our group is together and we are learning about the new technologies. Felix’s teamwork was a key factor in getting the project completed, he promptly finished any task given to him, aiding the rest of the group members whenever he had finished.
									<br>
									<br>
									As the website was not the main priority, the group did not work on the GitHub repository until the end of the assignment thus, I do not believe the GitHub logs represent the groups work quality.

									Since introducing myself to the group ‘Spurs’ and getting to know all its members, we have worked as a group exceedingly well. As with all newly formed groups starting to really work together and engaging in team work was slow at first and we could feel it as dates for assignments started getting closer. But once we had gotten comfortable with and started to better understand each other we started pumping out some really good work that we put a lot of effort into.
									<br>
									<br>
									At the head of the group is Micheal, from the beginning he stepped up and was willing to take responsibility as team leader. Great communication and delegating skills, allowing the rest of the group to work with each other more efficiently. Ricky was one of the most hardworking of the group, always being ahead of the work the group was up to in order to set it up for us. He really pushed himself and was willing to do work that had not even been allocated to each group member. Domenic was extremely helpful, especially when it came to our project idea as he was able to share extensive knowledge and experience playing and refereeing basketball with the rest of the group. Felic would give amazing input in group meetings, and always had a positive attitude whilst discussing and recommending new ideas. Tomoki and Thorpe both passed around some really good ideas and proposals, and would always have something insightful to offer to the team. They had outstanding teamwork skills that the group very much appreciated.
									<br>
									<br>
									We as a team decided that using a shared google doc to store the information and other necessary details would be more effective and decided to make the website after all the work was done. This means the GitHub logs will not show the real group activity.

									The experience I’ve had with working with team ‘Spurs’ has been an enjoyable one, as I have had fun working with and getting to know everyone in the group. I felt that time management is the major area that the group needs to work on in the future as the first couple of weeks after the assignment was given the work management and output wasn’t there. However, I was proud of the group's ability to produce work after that point.
									<br>
									<br>
									Of the members of the group, Michael was brilliant at being the leader, getting everyone focused on what was needed to get the work done, as well as being the chair in meetings. Collin had a great understanding of the project idea and his input around the idea was fantastic. Felix and Tomoki were both excellent at setting their minds on the goal at hand and getting all the work done to contribute to the team in a great way. Thorpe was great at pacing the group and helping out myself and anyone else who needed it, as well as improving the overall quality of the assessment. Ricky was the person who I believe stood out, as he managed to stay ahead of the rest of us in terms of work production and was always helping out and lending a hand to others within the group.
									<br>
									<br>
									The GitHub logs don’t accurately reflect the group activity, as the majority of group members focused on completing the actual work rather than the coding side. The log will show that most work was completed later in the time frame, but in actuality the website was completed later than the rest of the assessment.

									Our team strived for the work everyone has been assigned devoted to. We had meetings using the team twice a week, in addition, we had done extra meetings on Discord to check and support each other's progress. Overall, we were able to cooperate until the project was completed.
									<br>
									<br>
									-Michael managed the work progress of the project as a team leader. I believe that project has been completed by his excellent communication skills.
									<br>
									-Ricky has done any work on the project while assisting each member as a sub-leader. It is his credit that the project went according to plan.
									<br>
									-Domenic was the indispensable man to complete this project idea. The project idea eventually became better by his idea.
									<br>
									-Collin's idea is the origin of this project idea, his unique way of thinking was very useful.
									<br>
									-Felix was most responsible for his task. He often gave great opinions at meetings.
									<br>
									-Thorpe has checked a look at the whole project and has devoted itself to improving quality. The high quality of this project will show his high ability.
									<br>
									<br>
									Finally, the website was created last because we prioritised the completion of the content, but since it was basically created in an offline environment, the GitHub log does not accurately represent it.

									While our initial few weeks were less than perfect, I believe team SPURS worked well on this assignment. To improve on our assignment, we could have used better time management, as we completed very little work in the first few weeks and had periods of unanimous lack of work. I was surprised by how much work we were able to accomplish in such a short period of time after our initial bumpy start, which gave us less than a month to complete everything.
									<br>
									<br>
									Of the group members, I found that Michael was very good at coordinating the group and acting a chair for our meetings, Domenic and Collin had very good knowledge of the logistics of the project idea, Tomoki and Felix were very good at cracking down on lots of work at a time, and Ricky was very well organised, and consistently ahead of the group. I learnt that for group projects, communication is paramount, as we tended to struggle more when not communicating what we had completed.
									<br>
									<br>
									I don’t believe that the GitHub logs accurately represent our group activity, as many group members, focused purely on the writing rather than coding. The log also shows that work was mostly completed late in the project, when the truth is that the website was completed later than the rest.
