										<h2>Felix Langham</h2>
										<h3>Personal Information Summary</h3>
										<p>My name is Felix Langham, I graduated in 2018, my student number is 3885080, and my team name is ‘Spurs’. I was born in Australia but my whole family is English. My favourite hobbies include snowboarding and Djing and going to the gym. My experience with IT includes self-taught SSH, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I built myself a gaming PC and have hacked x-box’s and administrator controls on laptops. I enjoy tackling the many challenges that arise in coding, the puzzles to solve so that my python code runs properly or figuring out the correct CSS so that my website does what I want it to do. Furthermore, I am interested in learning how to program as it is a highly employable skill and can be applied to a wide variety of fields.
										</p>
										<h3>Team Profile Summary</h3>
										<p>My Myers Briggs test result showed the 'Commander' profile with code: ENTJ-A. Characteristics include: ENTJs are planners who often have schedules and courses of action planned. Highly rational, excel at taking charge and good at spotting problems. I would say this is somewhat accurate, as I like to make schedules, however I don't always follow through with them. Some strengths and weaknesses associated with ENTJs include being efficient, energetic and strong willed, as well as being stubborn, dominant and cold. As for my team composition and how these characteristics would impact behaviour in a group, results show that ENTJ’s would work well as leaders, however I would also be fine to have other leaders in the group and be delegated tasks from others. Furthermore, I think being direct and dominant could factor in causing group work to be efficient but at a lack of everyone being happy with the decisions made. Ultimately, these characteristics would not propose a big issue as I think I am able to be dynamic and work well in a variety of teams.<br>
										<br>
										According to this ‘VARK’ Learning style test, my strengths are in my ability to organize and plan in a  detail-oriented fashion. When assigned a project, I am able to easily establish order and structure plans. These results are inline with my Myers Briggs results and I would say they are fairly accurate. In addition, the results show that it is necessary for me to step away from administrative roles and share my own ideas and contribution to projects and not get stuck in planning and organisation, this is more true as I often find myself doing just that.<br>
										<br>
										According to the 'Big Five Personality Test' I scored highly in extroversion, emotional stability and conscientiousness. Whilst scoring lower in Intellect/Imagination and agreeableness. This means that I may be sociable, practical, calm, helpful and disciplined. These results indicate some of what has been shown in previous tests, being practical and disciplined and I would say are fairly accurate.

										</p>
										<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
										<p>My ideal job is one that is remote, is in programming or development and preferably high paying. The position I have found includes front end development work, likely web development, specifically using React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. For this position it is required that you have 6+ years of development experience, and are highly proficient in React, TypeScript and JavaScript. Currently, I have less than 1 years of development experience and am only slightly proficient in JavaScript. In addition, the job listing states that it is preferable to have some experience in .NET, Cloud, and eCommerce. All of which I have no experience in. In order to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for this job I am going to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Supplementing this with personal projects and freelance work building up my experience whilst creating a portfolio using the aforementioned stack. Some examples of extracurricular activities I might undertake would be: creating apps, websites and doing online courses such as CS50.

										<h2>Ricky Yu Qi Yao</h2>
										<h3>Personal Information Summary</h3>
										<p>Hello, my name is Ricky Yu Qi (Ricky) Yao, I graduated from East Doncaster Secondary College in 2020 and am now a first-year university student undergoing study for the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University, my student number being s3896813. I am an Australian born 2003/02/07 in Melbourne, Victoria coming from an Asian (Chinese) background. I enjoy playing video games and listening to music, it was the interest in both which led to my prominent usage of the internet and my laptop which increased my bond and affinity towards electronic devices. I am interested in the field of IT technologies due to its increasing growth and stability in the job market, providing a stable transition from student to employee in the future. Up until my studies at RMIT university, I had not before delved into the world of IT that much in terms of coding and network, but I am eager to learn. For assignment two, I will be working together within the team ’Spurs’.
										</p>
										<h3>Team Profile Summary</h3>
										<p>In accordance with ‘Personality Profile’ I was represented as an ‘INFP’. As an INFP, we are described as being quite open minded, such that we are accepting of other opinions, thoughts, and perspectives. Additionally, INFP’s are perceived as being quite creative, having conventional thoughts and ideas. Within a team-based scenario, it is suggested that there will be a low level of conflict due to my accepting and tolerating character and may bring forth many unique and creative ideas during project and open scenarios.<br>
										<br>
										Being represented as an ISFJ-T by the Myer-Briggs 16 personality test, it presents my character as one which seeks constant improvement. As a result, I can competently seek for errors within systems with ideas on what and how to improve/resolve any issue. Within a team environment, I will be capable of assisting my team mostly in assessing the final components of the project, looking for potential issues and problems within the final solution, looking for methods and techniques which could improve the quality of the project.<br>
										<br>
										Using an online learning test, I have learnt that I am an Auditory/Visual learner meaning I learn best by hearing and listening rather than “doing”. As a result, I can learn most efficiently through an online environment where a tactile learner may fall. Within a team scenario, I will be able to learn and apply techniques easily online if the online campus is somehow compromised due to another COVID-19 style outbreak.
										</p>
										<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
										<p>Being a network and/or security specialist is my ideal occupation. It requires qualifications within the fields of network architecture and cybersecurity, with essential tasks such as managing network infrastructures analysis of security measures and knowledge in technical support. Through discussions with the team, we have discovered that most of us are aiming for the long-term, aspiring to become a senior employee to earn stable income.

										<h2>Michael Lim </h2>
										<h3>Personal Information Summary</h3>
										<p>Hello, my name is Michael Lim, my student code is s3543066 and my project’s group’s name is SPURS. I am an Australian born Chinese, and a Fourth year university student studying a Bachelor of Mechanical engineering at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I am fluent in English, and have basic knowledge of speaking mandarin and Japanese. My interest includes all forms of pop culture, technology, weightlifting, and socialising. My interest in Information Technology started with playing video games, which I have played since primary school. During high school, I was able to take IT as an elective. I learnt the basics of programming, and made simple applications and games. I learnt that coding and designing programs was a fun creative output. My studies at RMIT have taught me many concepts in the field of engineering and how they applied to real world situations. I hope to continue my studies and graduate from RMIT.
										</p>
										<h3>Team Profile Summary</h3>
										<p>My result from the Myer Briggs test was “Turbulent Advocate” (INFJ-T). <br>
										<br>
										An Advocate (INFJ) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things.<br>
										<br>
										Advocate’s have the personal traits of introverted, intuitive, feeling and judging. I can definitely see myself having these traits. Being introverted, advocates are predominantly reserved when it comes to relationships. However, they communicate with insight and honesty.<br>
										<br>
										My result from the online learner type test was “Visual”. As a visual learner, the predominant aid to learn revolves around sight, an actual demonstration is easier to understand rather than a verbal instruction. Doing an internal simulation in their mind of the problem is a common way to help a visual learner remember or understand a concept. Ways to aid a visual learner in their studies would be color coding topics or ideas, lessening the audio instruction as they are easily distracted by sound and when learning in a classroom environment, sitting near the front as to reduce distractions.<br>
										<br>
										My result from the IPIP Big Five Factor test was a high percentage in “Extraversion” and a low percentage in “Intelligence/imagination”. As per the test, scoring high in Extraversion means to be outgoing and social.
										</p>
										<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
										<p>The ideal job I seek is being a Mechanical Engineering Draftsman. The expectations of the occupation include: Aiding the marketing staff with quoting the material cost and expenses. Design and development of  the 3D models of possible parts, and assisting the progress of designs in major projects. This job interests me due to including one of the main areas of engineering I enjoy, which would be the modelling of possible parts used in the industry. The qualifications needed to acquire this type of job. Namely having completed a degree in higher education of engineering, and the being of proficient in of the many 3d modelling programs such as Autocad or Solid works.

										<h2>Collin Ng</h2>
										<h3>Personal Information Summary</h3>
										<p>Hi! My name is Colin Ng (s3901105 - part of the SPURS group) and I’m in my first year of Bachelor of IT. I was born in Malaysia and when I was 4 years old my family migrated to Melbourne, which is where we’ve been living ever since. I graduated from Highvale Secondary College in 2020. I grew up in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne so my family and I are pretty westernised, and my siblings and I can only speak English, but we do still celebrate Asian cultural events like Chinese New Year.<br>
										<br>I’m super into basketball, skateboarding, playing video games (valorant got me cramming this assignment), working out in my backyard, and since Uni started, I’ve been really enjoying meeting new people and experiencing the Uni life. Recently I got my Ls, so I’ve been really getting into driving cars and car designs, especially the street car culture (JDM cars are so nice to look at).
										</p>
										<h3>Team Profile Summary</h3>
										<p>The results on my Myers Briggs Personality Type Indicator shows that I am an Entertainer (ESFP-T) with sub categories as explorer and social engagement.<br>
										<br>
										My responses to How-to-study.com - Learning Style Assessment indicates that my preferred learning style is Tactile/Kinetic. Tactile/Kinesthetic learners learn best when they can use their sense of touch and can move about.<br>
										<br>
										In the Truity.com - Big Five Personality Test I scored the highest in Extraversion (83%), being described as a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. My lowest score is conscientiousness (15%), meaning I have a very weak ability to exercise self-discipline and control in order to pursue my goals.
										</p>
										<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
										<p>A cyber security analyst has the primary responsibility of protecting a company’s networks, systems, as well as the personal data of both employees and customers. They are in charge of implementing threat protection measures and security controls. They also have to keep up with the up-and-coming technological advancements in order to survey how these advancements can be used by potential hackers or maybe even utilised to protect a company from threats. This area of IT I find the most exciting because of how you are in constant need to check and improve a company’s defences, and understanding from a potential threats point of view and how to stop their attacks.

										<h2>Domenic Sinni</h2>
										<h3>Personal Information Summary</h3>
										<p>Hello, my name is Domenic Sinni (s3900567 - part of the SPURS group) and I was born and raised in Melbourne and I am a first-year student after graduating from high school. I am studying Bachelor of Information Technology and I chose to complete my studies at RMIT for multiple reasons but mainly because of its reputation of being an excellent technology-based university and the location.<br>
										<br>
										I enjoy gaming, especially games like Call of Duty, NBA2K, Pokemon, Fortnite and Terraria. I also have a great passion for basketball and the NBA. I enjoy programming and while I only know the basics, I am trying to learn more and improve my skills in programming as I wish to be a programmer for my career.
										</p>
										<h3>Team Profile Summary</h3>
										<p>The results of my Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator shows that I am an Adventurer (ISFP-T). This result was unexpected for me, as an Adventurer is seen as more of an extroverted personality type, whereas I consider myself as an introvert and I don’t have that much creativity, but this test result shows otherwise<br>
										<br>
										The results of my Online Learner Style test show I am a tactile learner, which means that I learn and work best when I am doing and touching things. I am also surprised by this result, as I feel like I learn best by listening and taking down notes or actively writing down and taking down information. This suggests that I should try to do things while I work and I may learn more.<br>
										<br>
										The results of my other Online Personality test show that my personality matches “The Harmonizers”. I personally feel like this result more accurately reflects my own personality as I do struggle to interact with others, but I would consider myself as a kind and warm person and people that do get to know me would find that out. I also do try to be practical and aware of other people.
										</p>
										<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
										<p>My ideal job as of right now is being a programmer at a gaming company. I have a passion for programming and while I don’t have the skills as of right now to take on this kind of job, I am to gain the skills required for this job over the course of my time at university, by learning in class as well as practicing and teaching myself and learning from any other source I can.<br>
										<br>
										The skills required for this job include solid math skills, good communication skills, a passion for making games, the ability to work on multiple tasks concurrently, enjoy working with peers and with different teams, strong attention to detail and to be able to work without the need to be directed.<br>
										<br>
										The required qualifications for this job include a strong experience in using game engines (E.g. Unity), being involved in 1 or 2 major mobile projects, a strong background in programming and programming languages, and a tertiary degree or an equivalent qualification in a relevant field.<br>
										<br>
										I currently do not have any of the specified qualifications required for this type of position, however I aim to gain these qualifications over time, as I aim to finish my university course which will hopefully give me lots of skills based around programming and technology, and I will also start learning how to program games and gain experience using game engines in my own time.

										<h2>Sakamoto Tomoki</h2>
										<h3>Personal Information Summary</h3>
										<p>Hello. My name is Sakamoto Tomoki, my student code is s3821551 and my project’s group’s name is SPURS. I graduated from the National Institute of Technology, Kagoshima College in Japan after studying electrical and electronic engineering for 5 years. I was shocked by the high level of graduate students other than myself at the internship I did when I was in the 4th grade, and decided to go abroad (internship students other than myself are graduate students). I used to have a dog when I was in Japan, but since I came to Australia I have had four cats. and also mate cats and sell kittens. So far, I figured out buyers for kittens and sold 11 kittens.<br>
										<br>
										After studying as one of the college classes, my interest in IT began. The site I created after graduating from college gets over 300,000 PV every month and is profitable by affiliates and Google Adsense. For example, in an article I wrote about Nintendo Switch's new game "Monster Hunter" last month, it was accessed by nearly 5,000 people every day. Therefore, last month's sales $ 10,000 on Amazon. it's only the controller.
										</p>
										<h3>Team Profile Summary</h3>
										<p>My Myers Briggs test result showed the 'Virtuoso' profile with code:ISTP-T. Characteristics include: In my case, it was written as this quiet and unobtrusive personality type. In fact, I've never been good at actively expressing opinions in school group work. However, I am good at guiding team members fairly from fairness, rationalism, and comfort, and having the ability to properly arrange all tasks in view, so I work as an auxiliary supporter for the team and can lead to better things.
										</p>
										<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
										<p>For now, My ideal job is as a software engineer. In the future, I would like to develop applications and web services that people use on a daily basis. Also, I am interested in AR technology, so I would like to make something that makes full use of AR. But now I don't have the technology to develop applications. Therefore, I would like to develop a game-related smartphone app that uses the API during a student. (Already started developing it and plan to release an IOS app around the summer of this year.) First of all, I would like to make and release it and know what kind of things will be accepted by the market. I am going to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT to work as a software engineer in the future. I plan to develop world-class apps and services with the degree.

										<h2>Thorpe Honeyman</h2>
										<h3>Personal Information Summary</h3>
										<p>I am Thorpe Honeyman, student number s3897395, of team SPURS. I am a first year student at RMIT, studying a Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born to an english family in northern England, and lived there until I was four and a half, when I moved to Australia. I have previously studied IT as a VET course during high school at Mullauna College.  In my free time I attend scouting groups, both as a rover, and as a trainee cubs leader. For cubs I attend weekly meetings where I help teach the cubs camping skills and run games. I also sometimes attend cubs camps where I help lead groups of cubs to activities, and ensure that they stay safe. When I’m not doing scouting I am usually playing card games and video games, mainly roguelikes such as Enter the Gungeon and The Binding of Isaac. I have been interested in IT since my high school allowed me to do it as an elective, and I have had a continual interest, mainly in building computers and linking them into networks.
										</p>
										<h3>Team Profile Summary</h3>
										<p>The Myers-Briggs test said that I was an Adventurer, type ISFP-T, and as such that I express myself artistically.<br>
										<br>
										The Learning Style test said that I learn best from listening to information, or that I’m an Auditory learner.<br>
										<br>
										The Big Five Personality test showed that I have relatively average intelligence, emotional stability and conscientiousness, but higher than average agreeableness, and low extroversion.<br>
										<br>
										These tests express that I am easy to get along with, but have difficulties connecting with people initially. I also learn better when directly told information. They say I am a good problem solver, and that I show great empathy for others.
										</p>
										<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
										<p>My ideal job is working as a network administrator, as it is an extension of my interest in IT, and uses many skills that I learnt during my VET course, which was directed towards the networking side of IT. The main skills required for this job are the ability to create and alter a network of computers, servers, router and switches, and the communication skills to ensure that I do what the client wants to the network.

								<h3 class="moji">How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
								<p class="moji">With unique jobs being presented by each individual, it is clear that there is a diverse range of skills within the field of information technology including knowledge of various coding languages, cybersecurity systems and networking. In terms of difficulty, coding languages are ranked amongst one of the most difficult skills to acquire as it requires users to learn key operators and have a key understanding of their application. However, this is not to depreciate the value of other skills as they all have key concepts which require dedication and time investment to understand. </p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
								<p class="moji">In terms of essential attributes and abilities, they determined that the core characteristics required for their job were teamwork and communication based skills in addition to organizational and time management capabilities. It was identified that the ability to work together coherently with other individuals is an essential skill to have in the workforce in order to operate effectively to problem solve and ultimately meet the needs of client/organization.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
								<p class="moji">Top three ranking IT-specific skills are listed as SQL, javascript and JAVA in relation to March 2018 burning glass information. Though not essential, automation languages such as SQL and Java are very useful when creating network functions. In terms of other coding languages, python should be known as a baseline language however is ranked in 12th place in terms of demand. Javascript, though ranked 2nd, is not essential for a network engineer as their main area of operations are within networking infrastructures and not web developing. Used, but not recommended is SAP, however in the network engineering industry CCNA is preferred over deeming it ‘less’ required.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
								<p class="moji">All listed general skills are somewhat important within the workforce, however those not as essential within the network engineering line of work include:<br>
								- Leadership. Unless the occupation becomes a senior position, the ability to lead a group will be less required as management roles will be left to those higher in power.<br>
								- Mentoring. Similarly to leadership, unless you are placed in a senior positional role, the skill of mentoring will not be critical to fulfill the role.<br>
								- Decision making. Key decisions will be finalised by important personnel and not particularly for the role of a network engineer, though this excludes choices specifically within the network which require your problem solving and critical thinking.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>
								<p class="moji">Through analysis of my ideal job using the burning glass data provided to us on Canvas, it is apparent that my prior desired field to becoming a network specialist is not ranked very high in terms of demand and active selections coming at rank 160 with 56 active selections as of March 2018. Instead an occupation within the same field piqued my interest, with the job being a network engineer. This job was placed at rank 9 with 66 job postings. Similarly to network specialists, they both operate around networks.With similar job requirements, it seems like a good career decision as there will be more available work when I am ready to take on the workforce.</p>

								<h3 class="moji">How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
								<p class="moji">The IT specific skills required for my selected role would have been; Microsoft Office (word,Excel, ppt,Teams), HTML & CSS, Python, AutoCad, and SolidWorks.  With my selected choice of field being mechanical engineering, these particular IT skills are actually quite warranteed, especially in my field of engineering. In the general IT jobs,  having coding and office skills are also in demand as well.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
								<p class="moji">The main general skills required for my selected job are team cooperation, good communication, problem solving, creativity and flexibility. Even if it is not counting IT or engineering occupations, these skills are in high demand in any occupation.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
								<p class="moji">The three most highest ranked IT specific skills are SQL, javascript and JAVA. In my selected occupation, none of these are required skills as my desired occupation is more engineering based and the required programs don’t require programming.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
								<p class="moji">Overall, all the general skills are somewhat required by my ideal occupation. Even the task of taking a role of leadership, can be a requirement given you are promoted. In any occupation, most if not all general skills can be seen as a benefit to have.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>
								<p class="moji">With the added knowledge of the Burning glass data, it has come to my attention the importance of certain skills and the demand of certain occupations. I was pleasantly surprised, with the demand of mechanical engineering listings. I was disappointed in the fact of the low amount of listings for my ideal occupation of mechanical engineering draftsman. With this knowledge, I will now keep in mind to possibly shift my occupation choices. However, I will most likely still stay in the occupation type of mechanical engineering. </p>

								<p class="moji">In the field of programming and video game programming, many of the required IT skills in the field have to do with programming languages, and considering that a large portion of the skills in demand include knowledge of programming languages and other software tools like Java, Javascript and C#, my ideal job contains some of the more highly coveted skills within the industry</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
								<p class="moji">The general skills that a video game programmer would require would include skills such as communication, problem solving, detail-oriented, analytical skills and decision making. These skills are some of the most highly coveted skills within the IT industry, and these skills are important for a video game programmer to have.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
								<p class="moji">The highest ranked IT related skills that are not required for a video game programmer would include SQL, SAP, and Business management. While not technically required, Project Management and Microsoft Windows would be appreciated in the skillset of a programmer, however knowledge of managing a business, SAP or SQL management are not required and have little relevance to a video game programmer.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
								<p class="moji">The three highest generic skills that aren’t necessary for a video game programmer would include Leadership, creativity, and research. While these skills would be ideal for a video game programmer to have, they are not necessarily required for the job as there are other more highly coveted skills that serve a high purpose than these skills in a video game programmer.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>
								<p class="moji">After reviewing and analysing the Burning Glass data, my opinion about my ideal job remains the same. It has helped me identify other skills that my job will need and other general skills my job would require that hadn’t been recognised. There is still a large amount of demand for programmers within the game development field and while the pay isn’t the highest within the industry, the growth overtime is still a nice salary.</p>

								<h3 class="moji">How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
								<p class="moji">As an IT-specific skill, JavaScript is a coding technology required by all employers, and the skills required by each industry such as the game industry, network system, and security system are different. Also, it seems that software tools are also required for each programming technology.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
								<p class="moji">Since developing as a team, communication skills with colleagues and project management skills are especially important. It seems that these skills are necessary so that the team as a whole can take steps to develop, and cover each other as facing a problem.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
								<p class="moji">As a software engineer, the highest ranked IT skills include Javascript, python and PHP. All of these programming languages are needed to develop web services. Javascript is widely used in developing web services, and python is necessary for developing services that use artificial intelligence as services using AI increase in recent years. PHP is an essential skill in developing web applications. It is necessary for the process of directly exchanging data with the user.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
								<p class="moji">Overall, all of the skills listed above are necessary to some extent, but some are not important as software engineers.<br>
								- Calm demeanor: Compared to other occupations, there are fewer opportunities to work face-to-face and there is no direct conversation with customers, so it is not so important.<br>
								- Ambitious: ambitions such as wanting to be promoted or getting encouragement, but that is within the company. There is not much demand for ambition to raise the reputation of society as a whole like entrepreneurs.<br>
								- Positivity / Optimism: In the main coding work, often work on your computer by yourself, so honesty skills are not very important.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>
								<p class="moji">After looking at the Burning Glass data, I realized once again that I had to improve my skills for the profession I wanted to get in the future. The average income is high compared to other IT professions, but it can be seen that the required skills are high. In addition, the number of jobs entered in 2018 was 539, there was a lot of demand for software engineers.</p>

								<p class="moji">The skills required for a network administrator are, while not the highest ranking, highly ranking in terms of demand, with Microsoft Windows being the clear top skill. Apart from that, technical support and customer service are probably the highest demanded skill.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
								<p class="moji">Generally, a network administrator has a large range of general industry skills, with major emphasis on communication, problem solving and trouble-shooting. It is also very important that network administrators manage their time well, and research what they are doing to ensure high quality of work.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
								<p class="moji">The highest ranking IT skills that are not associated with network administrators would have to be the three skills with highest demand; SQL, JAVA and Javascript. These skills are all not needed as network administrators don’t need very much programming, with a little bit of command-line programming being the limit.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
								<p class="moji">The three highest ranking general skills that aren’t particularly needed for a network administrator are creativity, mentoring and presentation skills. The role also requires very little writing, but it is still an important skill for a network administrator to have.</p>
								<hr class="dotted">
								<h3 class="moji">Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>
								<p class="moji">Based on the Burning Glass data, I believe that my ideal job has changed to network engineer, as this role has more demand, and uses many similar skills to network administrators. This is also helped by the fact that network engineers are paid better.</p>
